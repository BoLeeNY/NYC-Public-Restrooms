# NYC Public Restrooms
## This is a website that displays all of the free public restrooms in New York public parks.
## It fetches from a NYC API that I found here: <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Directory-Of-Toilets-In-Public-Parks/hjae-yuav>
## I used the [soda-lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-lambda/soda-lab) as the template for this code.

# USER STORIES:
## As a user, I want to filter by location.
## As a user, I want to see if the restroom is open.
## As a user, I want to know if the restroom is handicap accessible.
## As a user, I want to submit a new restroom that I found.
## As a user, I want to edit a restroom to say it's closed.
